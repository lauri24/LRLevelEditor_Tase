## TO DO

* Need to add exact texture to TileObject that will then be loaded instead the empty grid. In future make layers for tile/tiles or view.
* Selection does not work correctly. FIX
* Add list of textures and other loadable data as paths, or with names to json, so you can load all textures or data in game at once or in some parts as you want.
